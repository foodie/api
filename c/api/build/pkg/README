The script in this directory will attempt to build a Solaris package
out of a source tree for API.

To build a package, make sure you are in the root of the source tree,
and run:

build/pkg/buildpkg.sh

A Solaris package called api-<version>-<architecture>-local.gz will be
created in the root of the source tree.

By default, if you attempt to build packages for api-util, it will
search for the sources for api in:

../api

You may override the location of api like so:

build/pkg/buildpkg.sh --with-api=some/other/path
